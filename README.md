- This is a Space Invaders written in Python with several changes. There are various alien ships that appear throughout
the levels that can take extra hits compared to normal alien ships. The levels are endless with some level of difficulty
spike. Some sprites were created using an external site and 1 custom 8-bit song ("suckerpunch") was created using BoscaCeoil.
